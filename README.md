safariExtension
===============

One upon a time, my boss send us a link for how to writing chrome extension.  I decided to use the same thing to pull a prank on my wife....  

In order to waste half an hour of my life in a efficient way, I decided to make a list in priority order to see what I can accumplished in the time within.  

1. make it into a safari extension  (its what my wife use)
2. change the logic to parse stuff on the web... lets turn as many meaningful stuff into shit!  (its the site my wife visit the most)
3. make it to facebook-only domain extension(incase she visit some non-enternainment related website and send out shit instead of serious stuff)
4. give it a laughable branding (so my wife will laugh about it and know its me, instead of worrying the computer infacted with virus)
5. make it happen randomly.
6. hi-jack link so it will bring her to some "awesome page"


Its more than 1/2 hrs of work.  I think I have hit #3 at the end of my half hour...
